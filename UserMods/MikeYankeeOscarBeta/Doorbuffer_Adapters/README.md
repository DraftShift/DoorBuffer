This mod allows you to use extrusions that are cut to the inside length of your front frame for monolith adapters.

### Only tested with R0 Printed Monolith AWD (pre-live shaft version)

Printable adapters for crossbar to clear monolith AWD front motors for Voron V2 with StealthChanger

Have to cut the 2020 to size.
The monolith AWD motors take 45mm on each side so the 2020 has to be 90mm shorter than the frames horizontal extrusions
